## What This Project Is

Single file PHP script that adds a REST API to a MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or SQLite database.

This is the upstream project, vendored at the pinned commit above and packaged offline-first. The 12 improvements Anticloud adds live in `anticloud/` and are described under *Anticloud Overlay* below. Every fact in this file traces to a file in this directory.

## Installation

Download the "`api.php`" file from the latest release:

https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api/releases/latest or direct from:\
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api/main/api.php

This is a single file application! Upload "`api.php`" somewhere and enjoy!

For local development you may run PHP's built-in web server:

    php -S localhost:8080

Test the script by opening the following URL:

    http://localhost:8080/api.php/records/posts/1

Don't forget to modify the configuration at the bottom of the file.

Alternatively you can integrate this project into the web framework of your
choice, see:

- [Automatic REST API for Laravel](https://tqdev.com/2019-automatic-rest-api-laravel)
- [Automatic REST API for Symfony 4](https://tqdev.com/2019-automatic-rest-api-symfony)
- [Automatic REST API for SlimPHP 4](https://tqdev.com/2019-automatic-api-slimphp-4)

In these integrations [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is used to load this
project as a dependency.

## Usage

Enable mod_rewrite and add the following to your ".htaccess" file:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ api.php/$1 [L,QSA]
```

The ".htaccess" file needs to go in the same folder as "api.php".

## Anticloud Overlay

The 12 improvements live under `anticloud/`. Run the check suite from this directory:

```
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Verification

SHA3-256 of `BENCH.json`:

Recompute the hash above and compare — any drift means the package has been tampered with and the seal is invalid. This is a self-assessment; no external audit has been performed and a SOC 2 / NIST independent audit is committed post-funding.
